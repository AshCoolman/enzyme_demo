Lifted directly from the excellent  [blog  on http://kyrisu.com/](http://kyrisu.com/2016/01/31/unit-testing-react-native-components-with-enzyme-part-1/). Head over to read up on how this works and show some love.


# Why

After a few hours going down research rabbit holes on how to best do testing in react native I found the above article.
